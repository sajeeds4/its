              <p>
                For clients that need extreme performance and modern developer experience, we decouple WordPress as a content API and
                build lightweight frontends with React/Next.js or static site generators. This approach keeps editorial workflows in
                WordPress while delivering faster page loads and better scalability.

              <h4>Enterprise & Multi-site</h4>
              <p>
                We build and operate multi-site WordPress networks with centralized governance, single-sign-on, and automated deployments
                to support distributed teams and large content operations.

              Fast, secure, and discoverable websites are non-negotiable. Our WordPress projects include performance budgets, image
              workflows, lazy-loading, caching strategies, and optional CDN configuration. Security hardening and automated backups are
              standard, and we follow best practices for plugin selection and update schedules to reduce attack surfaces.
