                For clients that need extreme performance and modern developer experience, we decouple WordPress as a content API and
                build lightweight frontends with React/Next.js or static site generators. This approach keeps editorial workflows in
                WordPress while delivering faster page loads and better scalability.

              workflows, lazy-loading, caching strategies, and optional CDN configuration. Security hardening and automated backups are
              standard, and we follow best practices for plugin selection and update schedules to reduce attack surfaces.
